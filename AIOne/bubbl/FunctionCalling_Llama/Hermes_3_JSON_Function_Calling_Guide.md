# Detailed Guide: Fine-Tuning Transformer Model for JSON Function Calling

## Problem Statement
The goal is to fine-tune and integrate JSON function calling capabilities into a transformer-based language model, specifically leveraging the Hermes-3 LLaMA-3.1-8B model by Nous Research. The model should be capable of generating structured JSON outputs representing function calls, parsing these calls, executing the corresponding functions, and incorporating the results back into the text generation process. This implementation will enable the model to interact with external systems or data sources dynamically during text generation.

## Detailed Steps to Implement JSON Function Calling in a Transformer Model

### 1. Fine-Tuning the Model
- **Data Preparation**:
  - Create a dataset containing pairs of prompts and corresponding JSON function calls. For example:
    ```json
    {
      "messages": [
        {"role": "user", "content": "What is the weather in New York?"},
        {"role": "assistant", "function_call": {"name": "get_weather", "arguments": "{\"location\": \"New York\"}"}}
      ]
    }
    ```
  - This dataset should include diverse examples to cover all possible function invocations.

- **Fine-Tuning**:
  - Fine-tune the Hermes-3 LLaMA-3.1-8B model on this dataset to help the model learn how to generate and handle function calls within a dialogue context.
  - Use tools like Hugging Face’s Trainer API or OpenAI’s Fine-Tuning API to perform the fine-tuning.

### 2. Integration of JSON Function Calling
- **Function Schema Definition**:
  - Define the functions your model will use in a structured JSON schema. Each function should include its name, description, parameters, and expected output structure. Example schema:
    ```json
    {
      "name": "get_stock_fundamentals",
      "description": "Retrieve fundamental data for a given stock symbol.",
      "parameters": {
        "type": "object",
        "properties": {
          "symbol": {"type": "string", "description": "Stock symbol (e.g., TSLA)"}
        },
        "required": ["symbol"]
      }
    }
    ```

- **Tokenizer Modification**:
  - Extend the tokenizer to recognize special tokens associated with function calls.
  - Ensure that the tokenizer can handle both text and JSON formats seamlessly.

- **JSON Parsing and Execution**:
  - Integrate a JSON parsing library (e.g., cJSON in C or Python's `json` module) to parse and understand the JSON structure.
  - Implement the logic to map the parsed JSON function calls to actual functions that will be executed. Ensure robust error handling for invalid or incorrect function calls.

- **Modify the Generation Loop**:
  - Modify the model's text generation loop to detect when a JSON function call is generated. Pause the text generation process, parse the function call, execute it, and incorporate the results back into the ongoing conversation.

### 3. Inference Process
- **Inference Setup**:
  - Load the fine-tuned model and tokenizer.
  - Prepare prompts and use the model to generate function calls during inference. Example prompt:
    ```python
    query = "I need the current stock price of Tesla (TSLA)"
    ```

- **Function Execution and Response Generation**:
  - Execute the function based on the generated JSON, then feed the function's output back into the model to generate a natural language response.

- **Example Inference Output**:
  ```json
  {
    "name": "get_stock_fundamentals",
    "arguments": {"symbol": "TSLA"}
  }
